# thundeR

THUNDER is a deconvolution method specifically tailored to address unique challenges of estimating cell type proportions in Hi-C data. Our algorithm is a two-step deconvolution approach based off of NMF, which first performs feature selection specific to the type of Hi-C readout (intra or intercrhomosomal contacts), then provides estimated cell type proportions using only informative bin-pairs. 

We are excited to share our pre-print for the THUNDER method soon!
